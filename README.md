Command-line tool to show posts from your favorite Reddit subreddits filtered by score.

Default configuration file for `fire` located at `$HOME/.fire.json`

Overview
--------

Every day I wake up in the morning and check my favorite Reddit subreddits for a good new posts.
Sometimes I have no enough time to do it browsing the web - so I've written `fire` - command-line
utility that keeps a list of my favorite subreddits and pretty prints current posts in console 
based on minimal score for subreddit I previously set in configuration.
